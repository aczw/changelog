It's been a while, hasn't it? I have less time now because classes have started again and this school year I'm trying to do [more things than ever](https://pennupgrade.com). But tonight was one of those nights where I didn't want to do any actual work, but still didn't want to sleep.

On these nights, I like to tinker with my website.

## BLURB DRAWER BACK!!!!11!!!

In [release 3.2.0](/3.2.0#removing-the-blurb-drawer) I lamented the removal of the blurb drawer, and wished to bring it back ASAP. I figured that now I had some time to kill, so I took a stab at a new, more performant implementation.

Well, I'm happy to report back that ~~AGI~~ it has been achieved :)

    <VideoGif folder="4.1.0" name="blurb-drawer-back" />

    **We're so back.** Visually everything looks the same, but that was the point. Under the hood,
    it now _only_ uses CSS (and some extra HTML).

In the [original release](/3.1.0#experiment-blurb-drawers) (prior art, perhaps), I figured out the problem of growing the drawer height upwards: by absolutely positioning the bar along the bottom, and adjusting the height. So now, I had two more problems I needed to solve:

1. Hiding and showing the blurb effectively
2. Positioning the bar correctly

I wanted to do this without using JavaScript, of course. Otherwise I would run into the same issues from the last attempt.

For the first problem, I simply searched harder, and found [this amazing YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_n4YONte5A) that employs `display: grid` and `grid-template-rows` to naturally transition between displaying and hiding content.

> I am not even kidding: as I was taking a break from writing this release note, I started mindlessly scrolling Twitter, which is where I found out that CSS now [natively supports this](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/animate-to-height-auto/) without using the grid workaround, beginning in Chrome 129!

> As of writing, the article I linked above was last updated only 3 days ago, so it hadn't even shipped when I first tried making the blurb drawer. This is proof that procrastinating on work has good consequences. /s
>
> Now, I'm sticking with the grid solution because this new solution is not supported by everyone yet (_cough_ Firefox _cough_), but I hope I can start using it soon!

This means I don't need to manually calculate each project's blurb height with JS. Alright, one problem solved.

The next issue was correctly positioning the bar. Since it's absolutely positioned, it's not following the natural flow of the document anymore. This is when I had a terrible idea: what if I copied the exact HTML of the bar but make it invisible and non-absolute, allowing the absolute bar to essentially "slot" into its place?

Turns out that it works really, really well. So I've kept it. Of course, I've labeled the dummy bar as `aria-hidden="true"`, which I hope helps with accessibility. After a bit more tweaking, I arrived at the look that you saw in the video above.

This solution is so stupid, but I've come to learn to simply accept such things, and spare myself a few more hours of searching for the "right" way. Also, the need for JS is avoided once again, so I consider this a victory.

I'm really glad that it's back now. Unlike a lot of other stuff on the site, this wasn't inspired ~~or directly ripped~~ from someone else. As far as I know no one else has done something like this before. So, it was sad for me to have to remove it. I'm truly happy that I've been able to bring it back, now completely bug free! (Theoretically.)

I can now go to sleep satisfied. ~~I'm about to sleep less than 3 hours though. Oops.~~

## Live indicator for music status

I've added a small, pulsing dot next to the song name. It appears _only_ if I'm currently listening to the song, right now, as tracked by Last.fm.

In previous versions, I was able to express this in writing, but since moving it to the footer I haven't really been able to communicate it. This new visual was inspired by a similar effect that I've seen people use on their website to indicate that they're open for more work or commissions.
