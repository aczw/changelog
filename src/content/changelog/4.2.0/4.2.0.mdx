As I'm typing this it's almost 4 AM. I'm really tired and I don't know why I'm still up and I'm probably going to delete this in the morning. I just need to write down what I've changed quickly while it's still fresh in my mind.

I mostly made changes to help with organization and clarity. I removed the MEWO quote because the text animation is better suited for this website's theme, and it took up valuable space on phone screens.

I added quick links to my socials on the homepage, so that people don't have to scroll all the way down to see it. This caused me to remove the resume link from the header, because otherwise it would be visible twice. _This_ caused me to add a link to my resume in the footer, so that it will be available on every page just like before.

I guess I felt that the header became too empty when I removed the resume link, so I did three things to change that:

1. I renamed "Posts" to "Writing" because it's slightly longer. Yes, I'm procrastinating on homework, why do you ask?
2. I added a link to my notes, which are available at [otherworld.czw.sh](https://otherworld.czw.sh). I've wanted to link to them somewhere a long time ago, but I felt that there weren't enough notes to justify it. Today, I think it's fine.

The third thing I did was add "czw" next to the logo. These are my initials, and I enjoy how they align with the logo when written out in lowercase. It's also a throwback to how I styled the _very first version_ of my site, which is live at [old.czw.sh](https://old.czw.sh).

> Yes, I host a lot of projects on the `czw.sh` domain. Another one is a [link shortener](https://charleszw.com/posts/link-shortener) that I built, available at [go.czw.sh](https://go.czw.sh).

It was actually pretty difficult to align the two correctly. In the end, there was too much inherent line height in the font itself, so I converted my initials to SVG, trimmed the space, and now I'm using that instead.

It looks nice. (I've already said that.) I've always felt that the left side of the header has felt a little empty. And if you squint, the logo kinda looks like an "a" so that the whole thing spells out "aczw" which is nice. (Said it again.)

It might also look like that to me right now because it's 4 AM. I can't tell.
